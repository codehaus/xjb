Get a subcontext java:comp/env, look up foo (should work), look up java:comp/env/foo (should work)

Next:
- Hook TransactionAccessor into DataSource (transaction.addConnection(conn) for each new connection)
- Parse ejb-jar.xml transaction attributes
- Non-closing connection should set autocommit off

When I call DataSource#getConnection(), the Connection should be added to the current Transaction (if there is one)
