  <title>Making EJBs Testable</title>
</head>

<h1>About XJB</h1>

<h2>XJB is a testing framework for Enterprise JavaBeans</h2>
<p>XJB enables development and testing of <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/" target="1">
Enterprise JavaBeans</a> without having to keep assembling and deploying into a container.
It is designed to allow a rapid code/test cycle, and to be simple to use. It keeps the
container out of your way while you develop your EJBs.</p>

<h2>XJB is designed for legacy applications</h2>
<p>Real applications grow. Many enterprise developers do not have the luxury of working on
small, "green field" projects, and legacy J2EE applications in particular tend to be big,
unwieldy beasts modelled on Sun's original <em>PetStore</em> showcase application.</p>
<p>XJB allows you to quickly test changes to a legacy code base - that is its primary
purpose. If you are developing a new application from the ground up, we would hope you
would have no need for XJB! Experience has shown that keeping the business logic separate
from the container or lifecycle plumbing leads to a more testable system and a happier
life.</p>

<h2>XJB is not a container</h2>
<p>Here are some things that XJB doesn't do:
<ul>
    <li>It doesn't have a fancy thread pool, or in fact do any multi-threading at all.</li>
    <li>It doesn't "deploy". So no ejbc stub generation or compilation.</li>
    <li>It doesn't do remoting. At all. Not a bit.</li>
    <li>It doesn't support entity beans.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, here are some things it does do:
<ul>
    <li>It creates home and remote proxies, so you get all the regular EJB plumbing.</li>
    <li>It understands the EJB lifecycle, so <tt>setSessionContext</tt>, <tt>ejbCreateXxx</tt>, etc. all get called at the right times.</li>
    <li>It provides a JNDI initial context, so your client can look up EJBs and datasources.</li>
    <li>It provides local EJB contexts, so your EJBs can look up other EJBs.</li>
    <li>It provides various <tt>javax.sql.DataSource</tt> <a href="datasources.html">implementations</a>.</li>
    <li>It (nearly) supports container-managed transactions (CMT).</li>
    <li>It understands <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt> so your test setup can be a
        <a href="getting-started.html#ejbjar">single line of code</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>XJB is currently in heavy development while <a href="team.html">the
team</a> works towards a stable 1.0 release. We don't currently
recommend its use in production projects but would be grateful if
developers try out the latest <a href="download.html#snapshot">development
snapshot</a> or a version straight from the <a href="repository.html">repository</a>
and send us feedback. Announcements of alpha, beta and final releases of version
1.0 will be sent to the <a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>.</p>
