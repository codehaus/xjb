    <h1>Null Objects</h1>
    <p>A null object is a regular object that behaves in a deterministically boring
    way. For instance the <tt>EMPTY_MAP</tt>, <tt>EMPTY_LIST</tt> and <tt>EMPTY_SET</tt>
    in <tt>java.util.Collections</tt> are null object implementations of the various
    collection interfaces.</p>

    <p>The point of a null object is that you can pass it around, use it, dereference
    it etc. just like you would a regular object. If you use them pervasively, they
    remove the need to ever check for <tt>null</tt> in your code.</p>

    <p>XJB uses null objects liberally for things like the container-managed
    <tt>Transaction</tt> and <tt>TransactionPolicyHandler</tt>. The typical pattern
    is to have an immutable field in the interface definition called <tt>NULL</tt>.</p>

    <p>We are using the null object implementation from
    <a href="http://proxytoys.codehaus.org">ProxyToys</a>, so the usage looks like:</p>
    <div class="Java Source"><pre>
public interface Transaction {
    Transaction <b>NULL</b> = (Transaction)<b>Null.object</b>(Transaction.class);
}
    </pre></div>

    <p>You'll see these scattered all over the code base - they are a very useful habit
    to get into.</p>

    <p>TODO - talk about Null DataSource and registering DataSources with
    <tt>xjb-config.xml</tt></p>
