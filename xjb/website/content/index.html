    <h1>About jMock</h1>
    
    <p>jMock is a library for testing Java code using 
    <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com">mock objects</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Mock objects help you design and test the interactions between 
    the objects in your programs.</p>
    
    <p>The jMock package:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>makes it quick and easy to define mock objects, so you don't
      break the rhythm of programming.</li>
      <li>lets you define flexible constraints over object interactions, 
      reducing the brittleness of your tests.</li>
      <li>is easy to extend.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>jMock is currently in heavy development while
    <a href="team.html">the team</a> work towards a stable 
    1.0 release.  We don't currently recommend its use in
    production projects but would be grateful if developers
    try out the latest
    <a href="download.html#snapshot">development snapshot</a>
