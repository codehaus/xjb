In order to build XJB from source, you must put the j2ee.jar file (version 1.4) in the lib folder.

The only legal way to get this jar is by installing the J2EE 1.4 SDK http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/download.html#sdk

(Also make sure you add no other jars to lib - especially no ejb.jar, as this may conflict with j2ee.jar).
